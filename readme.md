# Simple RAG

This repositorie contains the implementation of a simple RAG infrastructure to implement a POC in a client.
The main ideia here is to start the project with the starter set up and show value (simplification in acessing relevant and updated documentation without issues.)

To get started running the project just run 

```./init.sh```

And the database will run alongside with the API offering the endpoints for document insertion and information retrieval.
